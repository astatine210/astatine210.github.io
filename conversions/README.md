# Readme file for HTML unit conversion tool

## What is this?

It's a quick unit conversion tool, written as some static webpages.

## Why did you write it?

I work in engineering, and I frequently see people making mistakes and taking too long converting units. I wanted to make it as simple and quick as possible for other people.

This isn't the version I wrote at work. I rewrote it from scratch at home.

## Who is it for?

Most people who need to convert units betwen metric and non-metric systems quickly and frequently.

## How do I use it?

Enter a number next to a unit. To see the unit converted to all other units, press enter, or tab to another input field, 

The + and - buttons under the list of units will increase or decrease the decimal point precision of the result.

## Are you planning on making any changes?

If someone asks nicely I might add a version that's geared towards cookery, astrophysics, or some other field I didn't originally consider.
